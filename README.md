## Libgdx Oboe

An audio component replacement for [**Libgdx**][libgdx] library, which allows music to flow without any delay or another nasty Android-related distortion. 

And if you ever asked yourself *"Why is my Libgdx app music is so broken ?"*, then you came to the right place.

(Well, you also have to wait for it, because this library is in "work in progress" stage)
